## Features
* Cash Withdrawal and Deposit
  - Customers must have the Bank Easy app preinstalled in their device to perform a transaction. Once installed, users will be able to scan their credit/debit card through our NFC-powered payment app across the contactless symbol present on the ATM machine. The NFC reader will be integrated with the mobile app and can only be used to perform transactions if customers allow the access using biometric scan making the app more secure. The user can enter the amount, choose their required denomination, and enter the pin number. Users will be then redirected to 15 seconds lasting QR reader. The ATM machine will provide the user with a QR code, which is unique for each machine and will change after each transaction. On scanning the QR code,entering the MPIN  and inserting the BEKey as a final 2FA system, cash can be withdrawn. This solution with QR code-based withdrawal is also safer than the conventional method of using a card in a way as it eliminates the risk of skimming. The entire transaction is finally stored in a private tangle network to ensure safety of the users, legitimacy in the transaction and will provide a seamless cash withdrawal experience with enhanced security.
